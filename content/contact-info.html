	You can send me (preferrably) love or hate (not preferred) messages to my e-mail address.
	<br>
	Yes, replace the " (dot) "'s with dots and " (at) " with @. Hopefully not all spam bots will get my e-mail address that way.
	<br>
	Depending on the contents of an e-mail I may or may not send a reply. Also, Google Mail may put your e-mail in my junk folder and I may not see it.
	<br>
	And please, <strong>avoid sending me spam</strong>. Thank you very much ;-)

	I use my Twitter account to tweet about my Spirit Knight fiction and other random (and possible boring) stuff.
	<br>
	Do note that I don't "return the follow favor" and follow all my followers back just for the heck of it. Follow if you think you like my tweets, else don't bother :-)
