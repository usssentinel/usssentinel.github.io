<h1>Spirit Knight fiction</h1>
<p>
	The world of the Spirit Knight is a product of my imagination, where humans and spirits coexist and clash in conflict. There's magic, there's demons (they are a kind of spirit!), and there's medieval-like weaponry - swords, spears, shields, daggers, bows, crossbows, etc.

	I'm in the process of making a reference document for the world of the Spirit Knight. The document itself is an ongoing work in progress, and I have no idea when and if ever I'll really and absolutely finish it; there's so much content potential! Regarding the frequency of updating the document, I add/modify/delete content when I feel like it; the main reason is that I'm not writing this for money or fame, nor am I getting paid to write. This means I may update several or zero times per any one month.

	Currently I'm also thinking about writing the first novel based on this fictional world of mine. I'm having a hard time coming up with an appropriate premise, but one day I'll have something and words will flow. At this point I should mention that I'm not a professional writer and that my work is not edited by anyone. This sadly means there are plenty of grammar errors, but despite that I still think the content is readable and (mostly) understandable.

	My dream is that one day I'll be able to experience great games, novels, fanart, movies, etc. based on my Spirit Knight fiction.
